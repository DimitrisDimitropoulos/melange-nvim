# TODO

- [X] Fix grays
- [ ] Split into modules:
  - The color palette should be defined in a separate file, so that terminal's
    colors are defined by colors and not Vim groups.
  - Makes variants easier to mantain
- [ ] Variants:
  - Light theme
  - high contrast dark theme
- [ ] Better screenshots:
  - Explain that tree-sitter makes color more consistent across languages
  - showcase various languages: static and dynamic; with and without type inference; etc.
- [ ] TeX/VimTeX support:
  - TeX doesn't have a tree-sitter grammar
  - VimTeX is widely used and should look nice by default
- [ ] Organize makefile
