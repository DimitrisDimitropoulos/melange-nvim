# TODO

- [ ] Dark, high contrast variant

- [ ] More screenshots:
  - Explain that tree-sitter makes color more consistent across languages
  - showcase various languages: static and dynamic; with and without type inference; etc.

- [ ] VimTeX support:
  - The LaTeX tree-sitter grammar is rather limited, and it doesn't have the `conceal` features that VimTeX has.
  - VimTeX is widely used and should look nice by default
